# Psychic Game

## Overveiw:
This was a homework assignment to create a guessing game utilizing JaveScript.

## How you play the game?
Upon opening the page, the computer will pick a number and keep it hidden. The user will then select a letter and the application will tests to see if the letter matches or not. There are 10 tries available. If the user selection matches the computers it will be a win. If not, it will be a loss.
